# AI-Driven Pharmacogenomics Model for Breast Cancer

## Overview
This project demonstrates an AI-based clinical decision support system integrating
pharmacogenomics, tumor characteristics, and chemotherapy parameters to predict
treatment response in breast cancer patients.

## Clinical Relevance
Supports precision oncology by integrating:
- ER/PR/HER2 biomarkers
- CYP2D6, TPMT, DPYD genotypes
- Chemotherapy dose intensity
